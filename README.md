# Calendar-TaskList-WithAPI-Django

This project is similar to https://github.com/bhaktij24/django-restAPI-Project, but with additional functionalities.

Few curl commands that can be used for this projects are:

1. View the results through a rest call:

	curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/todos/ gives an error

	But if I pass credentials along with the url options, I can get a response. In this case for example:
	curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/todos/ -u 'viralshah:viralshah'

	returns me a json string

2. Create a user for the application through a rest call:
	
	curl -X "POST" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/signup/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"username":"bhakti","password":"bhakti1234"}'
	The above curl throws error, since the username is already taken, so just modify the username and try again
	
	curl -X "POST" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/signup/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"username":"bhakti1","password":"bhakti1234"}'
	The signup functionality for the new user works just as expected and returns a dictionary that has token in json format:
	{"token": "ds35fJ45Gdfs556wJUK12"}

3. Below command helps us get token generated by the django library. Execute below command and we are done:
    curl -X "POST" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/login/ -H 'Content -Type: application/json' -d '{"username":"viralshah","password":"viralshah"}'

4. With the token, we can perform actions such as complete as demonstrated below:
    curl -X "PUT" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/todos/1/complete -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Token 8a8bb03eafc77bd007a2ef9dff0d72477de9faf2'
